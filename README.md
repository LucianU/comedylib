# Comedylib
*A Kickass Comedy Library*

Comedylib came out of my passion for standup comedy. It's a project I built with
a friend for more than a year on and off. It taught me how to work with someone
and at something I believed in for a longer time.

## Project Highlights
* Originally developed as a **Django-based** application.
* Used **Vagrant** to manage the development environment.
* Explored **caching strategies** using Memcached.
* Integrated **PostgreSQL** for data storage.
* Relied on **Celery** to fetch video thumbnails via the YouTube API.
* Included **image processing** support via **Pillow**.
* Built with **Python 2.7** (reflecting the ecosystem at the time).
* Configured to run on **Ubuntu 12.04**, using **nginx** as a reverse proxy.
* Deployed with **Ansible** on **Linode**.

## Background & Evolution
This project was originally developed as a hobby but with the hope to make it
self-sustainable. It showcases some of the architectural decisions and
trade-offs I made at the time. While not actively maintained, it serves as a
reference for some of my earlier work.
